The goal of the thesis was to study and implement code-based digital 
signature schemes. The first part of the thesis contains the review of 
the well known code-based cryptosystems. After that it focuses on the proposed 
digital signature schemes which rely on the code-based cryptography. It reviews 
in more detail the McEliece and Niederreiter cryptosystems, which are dual to 
each other and puts them in comparison. In the field of code-based digital signature 
schemes the thesis reviews the oldest CFS scheme and the recent LDGM scheme. 
For the further research we picked the LDGM to benefit from its key size reduction 
feature. The principle of the LDGM scheme is demonstrated in a simple example.
The overall output of the thesis is a working LDGM implementation.
